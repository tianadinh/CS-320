# How can I ensure that my code, program, or software is functional and secure?
The simple solution to quality is testing. Users must, however, maintain their humility and be ready for mistakes when testing. The objective is to demonstrate or
refute that the code does what it is supposed to do and nothing else. This contributes to the popularity of independent testing teams. Doing the testing is the 
other crucial component. In order for the tests to function as part of the process and prevent the build from failing, incorporate them into the CI pipelines.
Do not simply turn off the tests if they fail; instead, examine and correct them. 


# How do I interpret user needs and incorporate them into a program?
Because the user may not truly know what they want or may not be able to express it clearly, it is frequently difficult to understand their needs. It is frequently 
helpful to use the Five Whys technique when elliciting. Shoulder surfing, which involves observing a user using other software and inquiring about their preferences
and motivations, is another helpful feature. Last but not least, making end-user mock-ups can help avoid a significant error in the software that is delivered.


# How do I approach designing software?
I approach the individual demonstrating the software with innocent curiosity. This is crucial so they can explain their vision to others. Elicitation can 
encourage the client to further explore their vision because they frequently don't know everything up front. In my opinion, the most crucial phase in gathering 
requirements is elicitation.
